## Email Harvester Script
A simple email harvester script using Duck Duck Go search engine.
This returns a few basic emails and the real benefit is to simply see how an organization structures their email addresses (john.smith@domain.com or jsmith@domain.com, etc).
The script prints to screen and dumps emails into a text file that is named using [domain_time].txt structure in temaihe same directory as the script.
